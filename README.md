# DubPlanner
This repo serves as a temporary documentation site and issue tracker for DubPlanner.

# Logging in
To use the app, login with your Linear credentials. Everything you do to Linear tickets will be performed under your identity. DubPLanner cannot do anything in Linear that you cannot do.

# Using a project
First create your project in Linear.

Add a Start Date (and preferably End Date) to your project. Don't worry you can extend the end date later and move the dates around.

Add team members to the project. For each team member added to the project in Linear you will see a row for them in DubPlanner.

Refresh dubplanner and you should see the project in your list. Click on it to open.

# Creating issues
Any existing issues in the project will appear in Linear. If they don;t just refresh from the display menu or your browser window

You can create a new issue by pressing "c" on your keyboard.

# Assigning issues
You can drag and drop an issue from the backlog section or another cell into a cell for a week and person. Changes are immediately made to Linear to add the appropriate assignee and week. Weeks are simply labels added to the issue.

# Milestones
Any milestones you create in your Linear project will be represented as milestones on your dubplanner timeline. Just create a milestone in Linear and assign issues to it. The milestone will appear against the week when all the issues belonging to that milestone are planned to be completed.

# Setting Issue status
You can assign issue status from the context menu on an issue card.

# Availability
You can set the availability of team members by the context menu on their avatar icon. Availability entries can be scoped to the project or global for that team member. For example a global entry for a holiday or vacation but a project-scoped entry for a week when they are seconded to another team/project.
